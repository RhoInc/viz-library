# Rho's Viz-Library:

## *A series of reproducible statistical visualization examples*

The purpose of this library is to showcase examples of statistical graphics created at Rho.  Examples are fully reproducible to support sharing and learning.  All Rho employees are welcome and encouraged to contribute.  Instructions for adding a new figure can be found in the wiki.  If you'd like to get involved, please contact [Becca Krouse](mailto:rebecca_krouse@rhoworld.com).
