# viz-Library - A series of reproducible statistical visualization examples from Rho Graphics

The purpose of this library is to showcase examples of statistical graphics created at Rho.  Examples are automatically pulled from the `\test-page` directories in all of our github repos - to create a new page, just add an example in the appropriate repo.
