# Outlier Explorer Chart for Clinical Trials
The safety-outlier-explorer library  shows participant trajectories for lab measures, vital signs and other related measures in clinical trials. The library is built using [Webcharts](https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts) and [D3](https://www.d3js.org). 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/RhoInc/safety-outlier-explorer/wiki) for more details.
