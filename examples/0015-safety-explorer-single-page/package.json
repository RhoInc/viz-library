  "description": "Example of the safety explorer suite, a simple framework combining 6 interactive safety charts in to a single page. The primary advantage to loading all 6 charts on a single page, is that the data only needs to be loaded once, and can then be re-used in all relevant charts. This example loads the data from csv (by specifying loadcsv:true in the .init() method), but the data can also be passed as json.",
