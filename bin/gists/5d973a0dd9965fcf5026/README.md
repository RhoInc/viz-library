This chart is created with [Webcharts](https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts) and plots boiling point by group across all elements in the periodic table. A bar is plotted for each set of elements in a period for each element group, and a circle is plotted at the mean y-value for each group. The y-values that are plotted can be changed using the first dropdown above the chart. Data represented in the chart can be filtered on period and group using the second two dropdowns.
